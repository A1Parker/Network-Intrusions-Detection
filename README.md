# Network-Intrusions-Detection

# 🚀 Cyber Security Threat Classification

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to develop a **Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** to detect cyber threats. It classifies network activity into **normal or attack (binomial classification)** and further categorizes attack types (multiclass classification).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries Used:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **ML Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix  

## 📊 Dataset Details
The dataset consists of network traffic logs labeled as **normal or attack**. Attacks include:  
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Neptune, Smurf  
- **Reconnaissance Attacks:** N-Map, Port Sweep  
- **Access Attacks:** Guess Password, Root Kit  
- **Other Attacks:** Buffer Overflow, FTP Write, Satan  

## 🚀 Implementation Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and transformed data for ML modeling.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized attack patterns and correlations.  
3. **Model Training & Evaluation:** Compared different models and tuned hyperparameters.  
4. **Performance Optimization:** Improved accuracy using feature engineering and tuning.  

## 🔍 Key Results
- **Binomial Classification:** Achieved **99% accuracy** in detecting anomalies.  
- **Multiclass Classification:** Identified specific attacks with **95% accuracy**.  
- **Performance Boost:** Enhanced model performance by **15% through hyperparameter tuning**.
